## Virtual Environment Setup (Conda)

Based on the given `.yaml`-file, create a conda environment using: 

`conda env create -f environment.yaml`

In case one wants to update the `.yaml` file, create a new file using: 

`conda env export > environment.yaml`

Some useful prompts: 

- list environments: `conda info --envs`
- Remove environment and its dependencies: `conda create --name envname`

## Data Sets

### National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey [NHANES]

United States’ main survey for getting nationally representative data on the actual health and nutritional status of people living in the U.S. — not just what they say in a questionnaire. 

Unique because it combines: 
1. Interviews (at home): demographics, income, health history, health behaviors, diet
2. Standardized physical exams (in mobile exam centers)
3. Laboratory tests (blood, urine, sometimes environmental or infectious markers)

- Target population: civilian, noninstitutionalized U.S. population. Certain groups (older adults, some minority groups) are oversampled so you can make precise estimates for them.
- Design: complex, multistage, stratified probability sample → you must use the supplied survey weights, strata, and PSU variables when doing analysis, or your estimates will be biased and SEs too small. That’s why there’s a whole “analytic guidelines” page
- Data files split into modules: Demographics, Dietary, Examination, Laboratory, Questionnaire
